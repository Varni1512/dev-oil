      question: "What makes your oils different from regular store-bought oils?",
      answer: "Our oils are extracted using traditional cold-press and wood-press methods that preserve natural nutrients, flavors, and aromas. Unlike commercial oils that use heat and chemicals, our process maintains the oil's natural properties and health benefits."
    },
    {
      id: 1,
      question: "How long do your oils stay fresh?",
      answer: "Our cold-pressed oils typically stay fresh for 12-18 months when stored in a cool, dark place. We recommend using them within 6 months of opening for optimal flavor and nutritional benefits."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "What is the difference between cold-pressed and wood-pressed oils?",
      answer: "Cold-pressed oils are extracted at room temperature using mechanical pressure, while wood-pressed oils use traditional wooden machines that generate minimal heat. Both methods preserve nutrients, but wood-pressing is an ancient technique that some believe enhances the oil's natural properties."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "Are your oils organic and chemical-free?",
      answer: "Yes, all our oils are 100% organic and chemical-free. We source our raw materials from certified organic farms and use only mechanical extraction methods without any chemical solvents or additives."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "Do you have any certifications for quality?",
      answer: "Yes, we hold multiple certifications including organic certification, FSSAI license, and ISO quality standards. All our products undergo rigorous testing to ensure purity and quality."
